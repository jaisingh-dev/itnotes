 <h2>Advantages of Java</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>1. Simple</h3>
 <p>
   Java is a simple programming language. It is easy to learn and easy to understand. It's syntax is based on C++, and it uses automatic garbage collection.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>2. Object-oriented</h3>
 <p>
   Java uses an object-oriented paradig, which makes it more practical. Everything in Java is an object which takes care of both data and behaviour.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>3. Secured</h3>
 <p>
   Java is secured programming language because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Also, Java programs runs inside the virtual machine sandbox.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>4. Robust</h3>
 <p>
   Java is a robust programming language since it uses strong memory management. We can also handle exceptions through the Java code.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>5. Platform independent</h3>
 <p>
   Java code can run on multiple platforms directly, I.e., we need not to compile it every time. It is write once, run anywhere language.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h2>Disadvantages of Java</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>1. Performance</h3>
 <p>
   Java needs to be interpreted during runtime, which allows it to run on every operatinh system, but it also makes it perform slower than the languages like C and C++.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>2. Memory consumption</h3>
 <p>
   Java program consumes more memory since it runs on top of Java virtual machine.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>3. Cost</h3>
 <p>
   Java programming language is a bit costly due to its higher processing and memory requirements. We need better hardware to run the Java program.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>4. Less machine interactive</h3>
 <p>
   Java lacks when it comes to interacting directly with machines, making it less viable for the software that needs to run quickly and run directly with the machine, as explicit pointers are also missing in Java.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>5. Garbage Collection</h3>
 <p>
   Java provides automatic garbage collectiom that cannot be controlled by the programmer. It doesn't provide the methods like delete() and free() to free the memory.
