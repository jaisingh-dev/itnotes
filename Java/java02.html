  <h1>JVM, JRE and JDK</h1>
  <hr />
  
  <h2>What is JVM?</h2>
  <p>
    JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you run the program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code(set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).
  </p>
  <p>
    Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine(computer). Since JVM executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.
  </p>
  <br />
  
  <h2>What is JRE?</h2>
  <p>
    JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provide Java class libraries, Java virtual machine, and other components that are required to run java applications. <em>JRE is the superset of JVM</em>
  </p>
  <br />
  
  <h2>What is JDK?</h2>
  <p>
    JDK(Java Development Kit) is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to JRE, JDK also contains additional tools(Compilers, Javadoc, Java debugger, etc).
