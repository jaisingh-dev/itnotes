 <h2>Features of Java</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Simple</h3>
 <p>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concepts of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Object oriented</h3>
 <p>In Java, everything is an object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the object model.</p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Platform Independent</h3>
 <p>
   Unlike many othet programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, It is not compiled into platform specific machine code, rather into platform-independent bytecode. The bytecode is interpreted by Java virtual machine. This makes Java platform-independent.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Secure</h3>
 <p>
   With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Architecture-neutral</h3>
 <p>
   Java compiler generates an architecture netural object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime System.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Portable</h3>
 <p>
   Being Architecture neutral and having no implementation dependent objects of the specification makes Java portable.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Robust</h3>
 <p>
   Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Multithreaded</h3>
 <p>
   With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to qrite programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>High Performance</h3>
 <p>
   With the use of Just-in-Time compilers Java enables high performance.
 </p>
 <br />
 
 <h3>Distributed</h3>
 <p>
   Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
