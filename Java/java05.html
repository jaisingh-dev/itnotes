  <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-oriented programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts :-
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Class</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Abstraction</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  
  <h3>Object</h3>
  <p>
    Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as object. For example, a chair, pen, table etc. It can be physical or logical.
  </p>
  <p>
    An object can be defined as an instance of a class. Objects communicate without knowing the details of other's data or code.
  </p>
  <br />
  
  
  <h3>Class</h3>
  <p>
    Collection of objects is called a class. It is a logical entity. A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
  </p>
  <br />
  
  
  <h3>Inheritance</h3>
  <p>
    When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object, It is known as <strong>Inheritance</strong>. It provides code reusability.
  </p>
  <br />
  
  
  <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
  <p>
    If one task is performed in different ways, It is known as <strong>Polymorphism</strong>. In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
  </p>
  <br />
  
  
  <h3>Abstraction</h3>
  <p>
    Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as <strong>Abstraction</strong>. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction
  </p>
  <br />
  
  
  <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
  <p>
    Binding (or wrapping) code and date together into a single unit are known as <strong>Encapsulation</strong>. A Java class us the example of encapsulation
